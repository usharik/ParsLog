# ParsLog
Simple log parser with JavaFX UI

With this application you can

1. put source log text into application by drag and drop
2. pars log from plain text to rows and columns by delimiter(defined by regular expression) or by fixed width
3. filter parsed log with regular expression filter
4. save parsed result as XSLX file for MS Excel or Open Office Calc

TODO application build with maven don't work correctly now.
